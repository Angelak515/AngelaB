<h1> Welcome everyone to an introduction of my webpage!</h1>
<p> Prior to becoming a software tester I owned a hot dog cart. I would set up my hot dog cart at baseball tournaments on weekends, enlisting the help of my children. With the variety of weather conditions we get in Ohio, I realized owning a hot dog cart is cool but not a good money maker.</p>


<p>I came up with an idea of a TO-GO restaurant that specializes in Briskets and Brownies.</p>

<p id="para1">I have decided to expand my menu just a bit but I am not sure exactly what to include other than whats listed above.</p>
<p class="greenp">I would like to offer a good variety of food items but also ensuring each item able be packaged to take home and enjoy. Once I get a handle on the menu and what customers like then I can alter the menu accordingly. Until then, I know I want to give a broad range of brisket meals but I do not want to leave anyone out. I need to cater to vegetarians and vegans as well. </p>
