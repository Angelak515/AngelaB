<p style="font-size:20px;">When I try to come up with menu ideas, I go overboard. I like to keep menus short and simple but when there are so many delicious choices, how do I decide? I originally chose to have a menu with a limit of 10 items on it; keeping down costs of ingredients and cooks. But now I feel I may need help with deciding what to add to my menu.</p>



  <form>
    <h4>Items That Should be Included on the Menu?</h4>
    Meats:<br>
  <input type="text"name="Meats"></br>
    Vegetables:<br>
  <input type="text"name="Vegetables"></br>
    Pastas:<br>
  <input type="text"name="Pastas"></br>
     Other Items<br>
  <input type="radio"name="Other Items"value="Rolls">
        Rolls<br>
  <input type="radio"name="Other Items"value="Smoothies">
        Smoothies<br>
  <input type="radio"name="Other Items"value="Seafood">
        Seafood<br>


  <input type="button"name="Submit" value="Submit">

</form>


<p> Although my heart lies within cooking, I would also like to take a deeper dive into IT; SDET, Scrum Master and Software Engineering. I originally thought I wanted to be an HR generalists but after working at various companies and seeing how HR does not help like I would want to help employees, I let that dream go. After being on a scrum team for the very time, I realized that a Scrum Master is the person that helps employees. They remove obstacles/barriers so that teams are able to produce deliverables. They know when to lead situations and has a clear understanding of both leadership and facilitation. Thats what I would like to do.</p>
